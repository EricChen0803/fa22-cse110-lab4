1. Output 3, the output is the value of i, and i=3 when the loop stop;
2. Output 150, the output is the prices[2]* (1-discount), and we get the answer 150;
3. Output 150, the output is the discountedPrice after rounding, and we get the answer 150;
4. [50,100,150], the function goes through each element in prices and calculate then push the result back to discounted and return;
5. Error, i is type 'let' so it cannot be access outside the for loop;
6. Error, discountedPrice is type 'let' so it cannot be access outside the for loop;
7. Output 150, finalPrice is global scope and we can access through calculating discountedPrice after rounding;
8. [50,100,150], the function goes through each element in prices and calculate then push the result back to discounted and return;
9. Error, i is type 'let' so it cannot be access outside the for loop;
10. 3, length is the length of the prices list, which is 3;
11. [50,100,150], the function goes through each element in prices and calculate then push the result back to discounted and return;

15. '==' do the operation after conversion of data type, '===' do the operation without conversion of data type;
